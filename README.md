# Process
## Explaratory data analysis
First, I explored the dataset inorder to get a high-level understanding of the kind of data i'm dealing with.
## ETL process
After importing the dataset into excel, I strated the ETL process using excel's power query. Using power query, I was able to exclude rows with empty cells in the description column, customer ID column, and item price column. Less than 1% of the dataset was affected by these transformations.  
The following tables were created to help analyse the dataset using the 'group by' option:  
- invoices table
- customers table
each table is further utilized in the next step. 

## Building blocks
The following tables were created to help analyse the dataset using excel's pivot tables:  
- invoices pivot tables.
- customers pivot tables.
  
## Visualizations
Using the pivot tables created in the previos step, the following visualizations were created:
1. Sales per quarter
